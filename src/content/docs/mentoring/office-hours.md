Office Hours Video! is a mentoring program as part of [The jbrains Experience](/experience/). Twice per month, members join me for a 2-hour live group mentoring session held remotely by video conference. They ask questions and get answers both from their fellow group members and from me.

## Mentoring?

During Office Hours, I offer **mentoring**. I’ve adopted the [International Coaching Federation](https://coachingfederation.org/)’s meaning of the term: I try to understand your situation and your context, then offer you advice on how to proceed. This differs from training or coaching, because on the one hand **you choose the topic** (like coaching), but on the other hand **I advise you explicitly** (like training). If you’d prefer coaching, we can do that, but that’s another service. [Let me know if that interests you](/contact/).

Office Hours is the place for you to go if **you need answers**.

> [I] just wanted to mention again that i value those office hours (live and chat) a lot. usually my questions are closely related to something that came up at work during the week, making your answers relevant and ease/calm my thoughts about things that came up that i otherwise wouldnt discuss with someone. – A member of [The jbrains Experience](/experience/)

## How Does It Work?

I schedule **two sessions per month**, one convenient for time zones in the Americas and another convenient for time zones in Europe/Africa. I deeply apologize to the Pacific Rim and Australia/New Zealand: I have to sleep some time. As a compromise, I usually schedule one session per month on a Friday night or Saturday very early morning (Sydney time) to give folks in those regions a chance to participate.

We run sessions for **2 hours**, although I often stay late if the situation dictates that. Don’t worry: if you need to leave on time, nobody will ask you to stay late!

A group of **usually 3 to 10 people** join for each session. We take some questions in advance and we take some in the moment. Although I’m offering advice, **I’m quite happy to see members of the group advising each other**. Who knows? Maybe one of my Office Hours sessions will help launch someone else’s consulting career! I’d love that!

## Which Topics Will We Cover?

My brain is open.

I tend to attract programming-focused people, but we can also talk about more general topics in software development, general business, and even life at large. (I am not trying to be a Life Coach nor a therapist, I promise.) Here are some examples:

- Evolutionary design, TDD, testing, refactoring, software design.
- Building helpful working habits, managing your workload, managing time, managing energy.
- Exploring products, splitting features, improving project plans.
- Interpersonal communication, teamwork, influencing others without authority.
- Becoming a freelancer, personal finance, serial retirement.
- Why am I so judgmental? impatient? quick to anger? frustrated?
- What should I do with the rest of my life? (No, really.)

I promise you two things:

1. If I don’t have a good answer, then **I will say so directly**. No bullshit.
2. If I think that we are moving into therapy territory, then **I will stop trying to advise you and encourage you to seek therapy**. (It occasionally happens.)

Here are **some of my influences**, so that you have an idea what to expect:

- I’m an old **Extreme Programming** (XP) dude.
- My bag of tricks is somewhat “Agile-shaped”, even though **I don’t push any particular framework**. (Yes, I’m an old XP dude, but that doesn’t mean that I sell XP.)
- My consulting practice is informed by the work of, among others:
    - Jerry Weinberg (Psychology of Computer Programming, Secrets of Consulting, others)
    - Virginia Satir (I promise, **I won’t try to be a therapist**)
    - Nancy Kline (Time to Think)
    - Robert Kegan (How the Way We Talk Changes the Way We Work)
    - Marshall Rosenberg (Nonviolent Communication)
    - Diana Larsen (Agile Retrospectives)
    - Patrick Lencioni (The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, The Three Signs of a Miserable Job)
    - Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister (Slack, Peopleware, Waltzing with Bears)
    - Johanna Rothman (Manage It!)
    - The Pragmatic Programmers
    - Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, Alistair Cockburn
- I combine systems thinking, Theory of Constraints, the 3X Model, Lean Startup, and Toyota Production System with empathy, compassion, and a focus on helping people adopt helpful habits.

There’s more, but that gives you an idea.
