I'm pleased to announce that I have started writing a new book, entitled [*Responsible Design for Android*](https://link.jbrains.ca/SpIUHM). I really envision this as a *series of short books*, not wanting to repeat the 750-page behemoth that was [JUnit Recipes](https://link.jbrains.ca/TEDGGm). 

In Part 1, *Dancing with the Android SDK*, I explore a sensible architecture for the basic Android app, emphasising *context independence* to avoid letting the Android framework swallow my app whole. I use tactics that have worked to great effect in working with older frameworks such as Servlets and EJB.

I toyed with the idea of writing an Android app in Ruby using Rhodes, but decided to return to my roots and Java, so if you're writing Android apps in Java, and have run into maintenance or extensibility problems, then I'm writing this book for you.

I say "I'm writing", because I've decided to use [LeanPub](https://www.leanpub.com) to compose and publish the book. This means that you can read the book as I write it, and your feedback and questions could help direct its contents. As of this writing, I've published three versions of the book, and plan to publish a new version approximately twice per week until I've written enough.

The sooner you purchase the book, the less you pay, and once you purchase the book, you receive all future updates free of charge. I have already raised the minimum price of the book once, as I have published more content.
