A model for improving the names of variables, fields, interfaces, classes and namespaces in a system. Practise this and more in my course, [The World's Best Intro to TDD](//tdd.training).

Here is a great example of a *structurally accurate* name:

You can find the original comic (and more) at [Geek and Poke](//geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2013/8/20/naming-is-key).

The classic name for this kind of class ends in `Util`. Smalltalk browsers label these classes as a code smell. I have used the intention-revealing name `JunkDrawer` for classes like these. Once, while working with a team near Philadelphia, we had an Eclipse project like this, which we first called "Dumping Ground", but which we eventually renamed to "New Jersey".

It seems that Geek and Poke have tapped directly into my brain. I will have to use this name in my projects.
