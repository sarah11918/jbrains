  - "Beware the Integrated Tests Scam (was Integrated Tests Are a Scam)"

<p>I made this announcement at a <span class="caps">TDD</span> course in Bucuresti this week, and I wanted to make it here: I now fully and freely admit that when I use the term &#8220;integration tests&#8221; I confuse people unnecessarily, and so I will stop.</p>
<p>As a result, you will notice me change from &#8220;integration tests&#8221; to &#8220;integrated tests&#8221;, because I believe the latter term better fits the meaning I intend to convey as well as avoids confusion with what everyone else means by &#8220;integration tests&#8221;. I agree to reserve the term &#8220;integration tests&#8221; for tests that focus on checking the integration points between subsystems, systems, or any nontrivial client/supplier relationship. Integration tests might be integrated tests, and might be collaboration tests. Your choice.</p>
<p>I apologize for the confusion I created, and appreciate you for hanging in there while I refactor my considerable library of legacy articles. That will take time and I can&#8217;t make it my full-time job.</p>
