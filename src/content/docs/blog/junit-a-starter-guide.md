<p>Not long after the Christmas break between 2001 and 2002 I wrote &#8220;JUnit: A Starter Guide&#8221; in response to a flurry of complaints over the lack of a decent JUnit tutorial. I didn&#8217;t know at the time that I would turn this simple tutorial, written somewhat in haste, into <em>JUnit Recipes: Practical Methods for Programmer Testing</em>, which I completed in 2004. It has surprised me to note that several hundred people continue to read the Starter Guide, so I thought I would include a link to it from here. In order not to deal with differences in <span class="caps">HTML</span> formatting, I have decided to link to the document as a <span class="caps">PDF</span> and keep it mostly for historical purposes. Much has changed since 2002, and I hope the Starter Guide remains a solid introduction to JUnit, test-driven development and software design.</p>
