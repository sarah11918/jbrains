title: Live support sessions
---

If you’re planning a **self-study course** and would like to add **live working sessions with me** in order to get the most from your training, then this is the right place!

Overview
To schedule live support sessions for your self-study training course, we do the following:

1. You complete the form on this page to tell me some things about what you are looking for.
2. We work together to design the program, including how often we meet and the structure of the sessions.
3. Once you feel comfortable with the program design, we’ll discuss the final details: how much it would cost and when we should start.
4. Once we reach agreement, we finalize our plans!

It starts by you telling me what you need.
