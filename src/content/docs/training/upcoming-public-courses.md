title: Upcoming public courses

If you would like to know when new courses are scheduled, you will find [a variety of ways to subscribe via follow.it](https://follow.it/jbrains-ca-upcoming-public-training-courses?action=followPub) or you can subscribe to a [“raw” RSS feed](https://www.jbrains.ca/training/public-courses-feed.xml).

In 2024, I began offering some on-site courses around the world, but if you’re not sure, then please ask. When in doubt, it’s safest to assume that the course will run online. Please pay special attention to the time zone in which the course is scheduled to avoid joining us too early or too late!
