Custom Training Programs
If you’re looking for training for a whole team or a small group, you might not need the formality of a standard curriculum and a fixed schedule. Instead, you might be interested in a custom training program, which takes full advantage of the most compelling benefits of remote real-time workshops. The schedule can be intensive or relaxed. Sessions can run from 1 hour to 1/2 day. The agenda can adapt more easily to the evolving needs of the participants. The program can run on a regular schedule or on more of an as-needed basis. The participants can change from session to session. In short, we have options that come from avoiding the constraints of a fixed-time on-site visit.

How It Works
We design a program together, based on your objectives, expectations, and constraints. We start with a general theme or topic, clarify the results you expect, draft an agenda and schedule, then we begin.

Design Your Program or Just the Intro
In order to deliver a custom learning program that meets the needs of the participants, we have broadly two options: designing the learning program up front and delivering the program incrementally.

The Design Your Learning Program workshop requires up to 2 hours and works best with a core group of no more than 8 people. After the workshop, you will receive an assessment and a proposal for your learning program suitable to submit for sponsor approval. From there, you have the option to engage me to provide the program, find other suppliers, or undertake the program as self-study. Explore your options for purchasing and scheduling your workshop.

The Just the Intro workshop requires 1/2 day. It is designed for whole teams or communities of practice (team leads, product owners, first-line managers) and is suitable for up to approximately 20 people. The workshop covers the material that participants would experience in the first 2-3 hours of a standard training course on the central topic of interest. You will receive a report of our findings, a proposal for further training, some practice exercises, and a reading list to help you prepare for the rest of the program.
