I offer training courses with a standard curriculum and a set schedule to organizations who want to provide a common learning experience to a wider audience. These are especially suitable for companies looking to offer courses on their internal training or education course catalog. I provide these courses as remote, real-time sessions in blocks of 1/2 day over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. I also offer support sessions to teams or other small groups who need further support to apply what they’ve learned to their projects.

If you’re more interested in a custom training program, these standard courses serve as starting points for designing a [custom training program](/training/programs/): “We need something like your TDD course, but with a focus on…”.

## Team Support Workshops

Many teams or small groups would benefit from further support to apply what they’ve learned to their projects. Support workshops are available in both 2-hour and 1/2-day formats to help teams or small groups feel confident about integrating the training course into their daily work. (See the course descriptions for recommendations about these workshops.) When you [request a quote for your course](/training/book/), indicate how many teams or small groups might need support workshops in the days, weeks, or even months following their participation in the course.
