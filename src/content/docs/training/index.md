## Standard Courses
A standard course works well if you need a **standard curriculum** and a **set schedule**. These courses provide a common learning experience to a wider audience, so they are well-suited to internal training courses through an Education or Training department. Training courses are available as remote, real-time, instructor-led sessions in blocks of 1/2 day over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. Browse the course catalog to read about topics and scheduling options.

There are a limited number of spaces available for on-site courses in 2024. Current options include mid-May 2024 in central Europe and various options throughout the year across Canada. If you’d like on-site training, please browse the course catalog then contact me directly to explore your options.

Custom Programs
A custom program fits better for smaller departments, single teams, and individuals. If you’re a team lead, first-line manager, or a technical leader, you might already know what kind of training you’d like for your group, but you want something more flexible and customized to your group’s particular needs. These programs take full advantage of the benefits of remote real-time workshops: more scheduling options, less participant fatigue, more time to think between sessions, and an agenda that more-easily adapts to the participants. Learn more about how we can work together to design a learning program that meets your group’s needs.

Public Courses
If you’re looking for a public course to join, then browse the list of upcoming public courses. Individuals can find courses that fit their needs. Companies can send one or more people to a course as an “audition” to help them decide whether to offer it more widely inside their organization. You can also subscribe to be notified when we schedule additional courses.

One-to-One Private Training
You’re an individual looking for immediate help with a specific problem. You might want the perspective of an experienced adviser or you might prefer a highly-customized approach to learning a certain topic. It’s not clear to you whether you need training or coaching or mentoring, but you know that you want one-to-one sessions instead of joining a public course.
