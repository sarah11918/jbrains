If you’d like to schedule a training course or program, then you’re in the right place!

Overview
To schedule a training course or program, we do the following:

You complete the form on this page to tell me some things about what you are looking for.
We work with you to design the program, which might be anything from a single standard course to a fully-customized program. We’ll probably do this by email.
Once you feel comfortable with the program design, we’ll discuss the final details: exactly when the training would take place and how much it would cost.
Once we reach agreement, we finalize our plans!
It starts by you telling me what you have in mind.
