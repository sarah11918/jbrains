title: Working sessions
---

If you’d like to book a working session with me, here is what you need to know:

- I live in the [Atlantic Time Zone (Toronto/New York +1 hour)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/canada/prince-edward-island), but I sometimes travel, mostly in Europe. You can usually book a session within two weeks.
- If we live very far apart in time zones, then [contact me directly](/contact/) and we’ll see what we can work out that fits both our schedules. I have shared the time zone inconvenience with clients in Australia and New Zealand.
- For sessions focusing on code (TDD, testing, refactoring, design review, code review), I recommend booking at least a 2-hour session.
- If you would like to propose something radically different, just [tell me what you have in mind](/contact/) and we will figure it out together.

## Prices and Booking

To book a session **for your company**, [browse the current prices](https://sales.jbrains.ca/remote-working-session/) and [browse my calendar](https://schedule.jbrains.ca/) for scheduling options. Relevant sales taxes are added at the time of purchase. Teams and other groups are welcome. Read more of this page for information and options on specialized working sessions.

Individuals (including if you run a one-person company) should subscribe to [The jbrains Experience](/experience/) in order to **book one-to-one sessions** starting at CAD 200. This membership includes group sessions during [Office Hours](/mentoring/office-hours/).

These prices apply to **working sessions only**. You might instead be interested in [scheduling some training](/training/) or booking me for a [speaking engagement](/speaking/).

## Session Styles

I’ve done all these things in working sessions with clients. Perhaps you need something slightly different. Feel free to propose anything that you might need.

- [ensemble programming, also known as “mob programming”](/ensemble-programming/)
- [What’s Not To Like About This Code?](/sessions/whats-not-to-like-about-this-code/) A serious game about design standards
