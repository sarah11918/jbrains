My name is J. B. Rainsberger. I help companies **profit sooner** from their software projects. I help individuals navigate the **complex world of work**.

## How?

How do I help you profit sooner from your software projects? In a handful of ways:

- I help programmers build habits that lead to **delivering features sooner**.
- I help product explorers (Product Owners, Product Managers, Business Analysts) build habits that lead to **asking for features that realize profit sooner**.
- I help managers and executives better understand how to **avoid the most common costly mistakes** associated with adopting - - Lightweight approaches to software development, including the much-maligned “Agile”.
- I help all software professionals in all roles build habits that help them **work with less stress** and have **more energy to bring to the profit-producing and profit-promoting parts** of their jobs.
- I help software projects by being “the fast-forward button”, which sometimes means building the early stages of a project to **help it get off the ground** and sometimes means refactoring designs to **drive down the cost of adding new features**.
