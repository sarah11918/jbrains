**Do you offer 1-to-1 mentoring, coaching, or training?** Yes, I do. If you’re an individual looking for 1-to-1 mentoring, then let me recommend The jbrains Experience as a starting point. By becoming a member of this group, individuals qualify for big discounts on 1-to-1 real-time working sessions, including mentoring, coaching, pair programming, and customized training.

**I’m interested in you mentoring my group/team. How do we start?** Use the form below to tell me about your group or team. What objectives do you have for mentoring? Which topics are of particular interest for you? Do you already know that you want (for example) a 2-hour session once per week or would you like to work directly with me to figure out the details? Include as much information as you’d like in the form below and I’ll contact you soon about how to get started.

**Do you offer live training classes?** Yes, I do. I have **limited space for on-site training classes in 2024 and 2025**, but if you don’t want to wait, we can organize a live/remote training class for your group. Explore your options for training classes.
